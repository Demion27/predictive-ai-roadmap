# Stock Price Simulator - Project 1 of Predictive AI Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Purpose
*Not just what it does, but why it matters:*
"This project implements Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate stock prices, serving as my foundation for understanding stochastic processes in predictive AI. The goal isn't accurate prediction but building intuition about uncertainty modeling."

## 🧠 Key Learnings
1. Mathematical implementation of Brownian motion from scratch
2. Parameter intuition: how drift (μ) and volatility (σ) affect outcomes
3. Visualization of probability distributions in simulation outcomes
4. Building reproducible, well-documented research code
